# Overview:
# - build-tracker (https://lh-build-tracker.herokuapp.com/) relies on a common commit that's shared between HEAD and master.
# - Lighthouse runs on pull_request, not push, so the checkout is not the branch with shared history, but the result of a merge.
# - checkout@v2 uses a merge remote (eg. remotes/pull/9605/merge) that often has just a single commit.
# - This script creates a new branch that matches the current checkout, but does have a shared history.
